<h1>Types of Programming Languages</h1>
<h2>C Language</h2>    
<p>The C language is a basic programming language and is a very popular language, especially used in game programming, since C language includes additional C++ packaging, every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster. However, the value of this language gives C++ the reusability to get the slight performance increase with C language.</p>

<h2>Pascal Language</h2>    
<p>Pascal language is mostly a language of teaching and this language is used by few industries to write the programmes. In C language this language tends to use keywords rather than symbols and braces. So beginners understand this language very easily than a programming language such as C, C++. Borland is a software compiler company that uses Delphi programming language for strength of industry. Delphi is an object-oriented Pascal language, and currently only use it by Borland compilers.</p>

<h2>Fortran Language</h2>    
<p>Fortran language is a language that crunchs numbers and is still used by scientists. This language allows varying sizes of variables up to the machine's memory limit. For engineers, who need to calculate values with high precision, this language is appropriate. Fortran 's program is inflexible, and it can sometimes make reading difficult. </p>

<h2>Java Language</h2>    
<p>The Java language is a language of multiple platforms which is particularly useful in networking. Of course, with Java applets mostly this language is used on the web. However, in structure and syntax, this language is used to design cross-platform programs, as it is similar to C++. Java language is very easy to learn for C++ programmers, and offers some advantages of object-oriented programming. Like reusability and the writing of efficient code in Java can be difficult. But the speed of the Java language has increased nowadays, and version 1.5 offers some good features for easy program making. </p>

<h2>Perl Language</h2>    
<p>Perl language is a Unix language for file management. But its common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming makes it more popular. It is a term for programs that web servers can execute to allow additional web pages capabilities. Perl language is a method of text searching and it is used for useful server functions and other databases, and if you have any experience in any language, it is very easy to pick up the fundamentals. Web hosting services choose Perl language as a CGi language over C++ language. Because the web hosts can view files from Perl script. When C++ is compiled, because these are text files. </p>

<h2>PHP Language</h2>    
<p>The PHP language is used to design web pages, and is sometimes used as scripting language as well. This language is designed to develop a fast website, and therefore includes features that make it easy to generate HTTP headers and link to databases. It includes a set of components as a scripting language which allows the programmer to easily get up to speed. It does have more sophisticated object oriented features, however. </p>

<h2>LISP Language</h2>
<p>LISP language is mainly used in computer science research, and all data is stored in lists such as arrays. List syntax is very simple and easy for developers to get structures implemented.</p2>

<h2>Scheme Language</h2>
<p>The language of the scheme is an alternative of LISP language, and has a simpler syntax and features. Any project under the language of the scheme will result in the mostly LISP language being re-implemented. But, this is very popular introductory language in MIT's department of computer science. This language solves the problems easily, rather than worrying about programming language syntaxes. </p2>
