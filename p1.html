<h1>Programming Languages Introduction</h1>
<p>Many programming languages are becoming more general and all-purpose nowadays, but these languages have their specialities and each language has its own advantages and disadvantages. Programming languages can usually be classified into a few types but these languages support multiple styles of programming. A number of programming languages are implemented each year, but few languages are becoming very popular which may be used in their career by a professional programmer. 

The programming languages are used to control computer or machine performance. Computer programmers currently have many choices to choose the language, but there are a lot of differences between programming languages. This article therefore provides brief information on the different types of programming languages, differences between programming languages and programming language types in useful ways.</p>
