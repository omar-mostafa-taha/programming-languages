<h1>Benefits of Programming Languages</h1>
	  <p>Every language has been designed for a specific purpose otherwise we would all program in the language of the machines. The first languages were in fact simple shortcuts into the machine language. Then as machines became more complex and their applications, so did the languages. BASIC is great for learning, but lacked the power to compete with the likes of COBOL and PL/1 (in most cases). But with the proliferation of PC-based computing came a need to be able to program more people with broader backgrounds.Each new evolution required new language elements or ease of use in order to get the same benefit as the older, more esoteric programs of the past. And it may not be practical to make those improvements depending on the complexity of the compiler or even anyone within the company who still knows how it works. So a niche opens up to a new language to take advantage of a new paradigm: objects need the languages OO and OOP. Whatever the next generation brings, evolution or replacement by those better equipped to survive will be required.</p>
    <p>The benefits of any language will be app environment control, ease of use, ease of maintenance, scalability and overall robustness, mean time between failures. HTML is great for controlling web pages but is poor at general ledger or payroll beyond reporting. COBOL and RPG are great for GL and demand deposit banking but not very good for running web pages. </p>
